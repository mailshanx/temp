# Top 100 Users of Arbitration in India

*Compiled from public sources including Chambers & Partners, Global Arbitration Review (GAR), Legal 500, SIAC/ICC/MCIA/DIAC statistics, Indian court records (Indian Kanoon, SCC Online), government reports, and financial disclosures. "Users" is interpreted broadly to include entities that initiate, defend, or are repeat participants in arbitration proceedings — whether as claimants, respondents, or institutional stakeholders.*

---

## Methodology & Rationale

This list identifies entities across seven categories that are the most frequent, highest-value, or most impactful users of arbitration in India. Rankings within each category are based on:

1. **Volume** of known arbitration proceedings (domestic and international)
2. **Value** of claims/awards (publicly reported)
3. **Systemic importance** — entities whose arbitration activity shapes policy and jurisprudence
4. **Public reporting** — only entities with verifiable arbitration involvement from court records, annual reports, news, or ranking agencies

---

## CATEGORY A: Government & Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)

*Rationale: The Indian government is the single largest litigant in the country, and PSUs are by far the most prolific users of arbitration. Government contracts — particularly in infrastructure, energy, and defence — routinely include arbitration clauses. The Ministry of Finance's 2024 Guidelines acknowledged that approximately 2,600 arbitration awards were issued in highway disputes alone, with claims totaling ~INR 90,000 crore.*

| # | Entity | Sector | Basis for Inclusion |
|---|--------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | **National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)** | Infrastructure | India's single largest arbitration user. ~2,600 awards issued; claims of ~INR 90,000 crore; awards of ~INR 30,000 crore. Party to landmark cases including *NHAI v. HCC*, *NHAI v. IRB Infrastructure* (INR 1,720 crore award). Government scrapped arbitration for highway disputes above INR 10 crore in 2025 due to volume. ([Swarajya](https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/india-scraps-arbitration-for-highway-disputes-above-10-crore-in-major-contract-overhaul); [Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/irb-infra-trust-wins-rs-1-720-cr-arbitration-award-for-highway-project-124012800464_1.html)) |

| 4 | **Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)** | Transport | Party to INR 75-76 billion award (DMRC v. DAMEPL) — India's largest domestic arbitration award and most controversial (set aside by Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction in 2024). Triggered Ministry of Finance's 2024 Guidelines. ([Kluwer Arbitration Blog](https://legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com/arbitration-blog/2024-year-in-review-arbitration-in-india-reset-or-rewind/)) |
| 5 | **Indian Railways / IRCON International** | Transport | Massive construction and procurement portfolio; routine arbitration clauses in contractor agreements. HCC cited disputes with IRCON among its arbitration portfolio. |

([Kluwer Arbitration Blog](http://arbitrationblog.kluwerarbitration.com/2021/08/17/the-antrix-devas-dispute-headed-for-a-third-bit-arbitration/)) |
| 8 | **Union of India (through Ministry of Defence)** | Defence | Routine arbitration in defence procurement contracts. Shapoorji Pallonji v. Union of India (2023) involved redevelopment disputes.

## CATEGORY B: State Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOMs)

*Rationale: DISCOMs are among the most frequent respondents in arbitration. PPA disputes between generators and DISCOMs are a major source of arbitration caseload. The financial stress of DISCOMs (government injected INR 90,000 crore in liquidity support) drives payment disputes that frequently go to arbitration.*
